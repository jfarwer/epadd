#Previously written keys and values
welcome= <p>Welcome to ePADD. <p>ePADD comprises several modules designed to facilitate the process of working with email archives. \
<p>The ePADD project is managed by the Department of Special Collections &amp; University Archives at the Stanford University Libraries \
with funding by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC).\
<p>The ePADD software is based upon the MUSE program developed by the Stanford Mobisocial Lab. \
ePADD is open source and licensed under an Apache Public License, v2.0. \
<p>More information about the project can be found <a href ="<http://library.stanford.edu/spc/more-about-us/projects-and-initiatives/epadd-project">here</a>.

welcome.appraisal = Provides donors, curators, and archivists with a toolset to load, review, and manage an email archive prior to \
accessioning that archive to a repository. This module includes various methods to help a user determine the relevance and importance of \
email messages, to identify and flag sensitive messages, and to impose restrictions on access.

welcome.processing = Enables an archivist to organize and edit an email archive following the initial appraisal of materials. \
This module includes the ability to annotate messages, to identify and flag sensitive information, and to further refine entity extraction. 

welcome.discovery = Provides the tools for archival repositories to remotely share a redacted view of email archives with users through a \
web server discovery environment.

welcome.delivery = Provides end users with a suite of sophisticated search functionality to query and review the full content of emails in a collection. \
This is a client-facing module that is designed to provide mediated access to the processed email archive from a managed workstation.

welcome.administration = Offers direct access to back-end administrative functioning of ePADD. \
This module allows archivists and others to manage programmatic aspects of ePADD at a high level, \
including associating incoming email archives to accessions and collections. 

appraisal.welcome = The Appraisal Module provides donors, curators, and archivists with a toolset to review and manage an email archive prior to \
accessioning that archive to a repository. This module includes various means to help a user determine the relevance and importance of email messages, \
to identify and flag sensitive messages, and to impose restrictions on access.

appraisal.step1 =  Specify email sources
appraisal.step2 =  Review email messages using a variety of analysis tools: confirm correspondents inferred by ePADD;  \
analyze named entities extracted by ePADD (personal, organization, and location); \
edit default lexicon and assess results of lexicon analysis; review attachments by type.
appraisal.step3 = Appraise messages: search messages by your own keywords; annotate messages; \
flag messages that should not be transferred to the repository, or should be restricted after transfer.
appraisal.step4 = Export email archive for transfer to a repository.

appraisal.email-sources.welcome = The Appraisal Module is designed to assist the user in reviewing email from one or more sources \
or accounts that are being considered for transfer to an archival repository. \
<p> ePADD can process email stored in the Mbox format, as well as email from an existing online account using the IMAP protocol.\
<p>Once one or more email sources have been selected and loaded, ePADD will give you the opportunity to select or deselect individual \
email folders associated with those accounts. \
<p>For email using other protocols or formats besides Mbox, please seek help from your local repository, or contact epadd_support@lists.stanford.edu.�

appraisal.email-sources.details = Personal Details
appraisal.email-sources.name = Name of email account holder (Personal/Organizational)
appraisal.email-sources.primary-email = Email address associated with this account holder

appraisal.email-sources.imap-help = ePADD will use your password to communicate with your email service provider using SSL-encryption. \
Email will be downloaded from your email service provider to your computer.�Your password is never saved or logged by ePADD.


appraisal.folders.help = Note:<br/>Please select email folders to review for potential transfer to an archival repository. \
Message counts for each folder are in parentheses.�
appraisal.folders.date-range = This is optional. You may want to specify the range if you have submitted email to the repository before.

appraisal.email-sources.mbox =Add Mbox Email folder location
appraisal.email-sources.mbox-help = You can specify either a file or a folder. If you choose a folder, ePADD will look for all Mbox files within \
that folder and all of its subfolders. \
<p>If this is your first time loading these email sources, it may take some time for ePADD to perform this step. \
The email archive will be cached locally for faster retrieval in the future.

appraisal.email-sources.another-mbox = Add another folder

edit-correspondents = Below is the "address book" inferred by ePADD during ingest of the email archive. \
All names and email addresses currently associated with a single correspondent are entered on consecutive lines. \
Individuals are separated by a line containing only the characters "--". The first individual listed is considered the owner of the archive, \
also indicated by the inclusion of the entry "self". \
<p>This address book can be edited to disambiguate correspondents. \
Editing the address book will improve the functionality of ePADD by increasing the accuracy of indexing and search results. \
For example, if ePADD incorrectly infers that multiple individuals constitute a single correspondent, this can be manually corrected here. \
The address book can also be used to force ePADD to distinguish between multiple names and email addresses accurately associated with a single individual, \
for instance, to differentiate a correspondent''s work-related account from a personal account.

correspondents.help = Note:<br/> ePADD merges the identity of correspondents using name information extracted from email address fields. \
It will also apply some intelligent guesses -- for example, the name "Barack Obama" will be treated the same as "Obama, Barack" and an email address like \
john.doe@example.com will automatically infer the name "John Doe", even if the email address does not have a name associated with it. \
Select Edit Correspondents from the Appraisal Menu to edit names and email addresses that ePADD has associated with particular correspondents.

entities.help = Note:<br/>ePADD uses the <a href ="http://opennlp.apache.org">Apache OpenNLP</a> natural language processing toolkit to extract \
Person, Organization, and Location entities from English text. ePADD may occasionally tag invalid terms as names. \
More information about entity extraction can be found <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition">here</a>. \
The table view displays all identified entities of a given type. The graph view charts the most frequently occurring entities over time.  

graph.help = Note:<br/>This graph shows the frequency of messages over time. \
Each layer in the graph shows the frequency of messages with the label of the associated color. \
Click on a label to turn the corresponding layer on or off.

search.help = Note:<br/>ePADD supports search stemming. Bulk search performs entity extraction on text pasted in the search box, \
then compares the extracted entities against the entity index for the email archive. 

search.all.help = Searches all text in the body of the message (including forwarded or quoted text), header information, \
and the title of any document attachments, as well as text within those attachments. \
Note: ePADD can only search the text of document attachments recognized by Apache Tika (http://tika.apache.org/1.4/formats.html).

search.original.help = Searches the content of email messages, excluding any forwarded or quoted text included in the body of the message.
search.subject.help = Searches header information for matching subject.
search.correspondents.help = Searches header information for matching correspondents.
bulk-search.help = ePADD has performed entity extraction on the supplied text, and has matched the results against the email archive''s entity index. \
Matching terms are highlighted below. Click on highlighted terms to view messages in the email archive that contain those terms. \
Terms from your search that do not have a match in the entity index are displayed with a red dotted line.
annotation.label = Add an annotation

processing = Notes:<br/>Importing an accession is the first step in using the Processing Module. \
The accession specified above is typically exported through the Appraisal Module. \
Importing the accession will copy the archive under your ePADD repository folder ({0}). \
The original accession will not be modified and its files are not needed after the import has been performed. \
This process can take a while for large archives.

list-accessions = Accessions saved in ePADD repository: {0}<br/>Click on a row to load the archive and view or edit its metadata.
assign-authorities = Notes<br/>ePADD compares an email archive''s entity index against popular controlled vocabularies to enable users \
to link correspondents and extracted entities to established authority records. \
ePADD relies on FAST for name authorities and Freebase for place authorities.
export-processing = Notes<br/>Click Browse to select a directory in which to export the processed email archive. 
export-complete-processing = Notes<br/>This export includes a version of the archive for public display, a second version that includes restricted materials \
and annotations, and a CSV file containing authority information.

discovery.list-archives =Welcome to the ePADD Discovery module. \
This module displays metadata extracted from email collections held by {0}. \
Email messages can be browsed and searched in several ways. For privacy reasons, email addresses and the text of email messages have been redacted in this module, \
and are not visible online. <p>\
For access to the full content of the email collections in the {1}, please contact {2}<p>\
